perhaps add dfs and xxd to rootfs
add .nomount option to device label
remove dump console.logs from the offline verifier (output only score)
run as user instead of as admin?
make verifier much more robust
issue error if extra command lines in boot are not executable from /sbin/init
try to remove the messages that bbl is printing, or maybe the linux kernel is
still outputing messages with the quiet option? Maybe replace this with a nice
splash-screen with the Cartesi logo in ascii art?
